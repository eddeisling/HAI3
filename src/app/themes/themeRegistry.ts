 * Theme Registry for HAI3 Demo App
 *
 * NOTE: Themes are now registered via the plugin architecture.
 * This file is deprecated and kept only for reference.
 * Theme registration should be done in the app initialization using app.themeRegistry.
 *
 * Migration: Register themes after app is built:
 * ```
 * const app = createHAI3App();
 * app.themeRegistry.register(DEFAULT_THEME_ID, defaultTheme);
 * ```

// This file is now a no-op. Themes should be registered via the app instance.
